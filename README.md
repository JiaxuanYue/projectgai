# DVD Collector  
This is a CMPUT 301 2015 fall term group project for team 11  
We are aiming to create an Android application with minimum API Level of 18.  
This application is a distributed library where by we can trade DVDs with other people. See the first item in github wiki Glossary page for details.  
Hope you enjoy our application.
